              <strong>Dear Hendriko</strong>
<p>You've been the most amazing friend to me. We were once strangers to each other but over time I warmed up to you and began to enjoy your company. It was all going well until you were the only thing on my mind. I think of you all day and all night now. My heart would skip a beat everytime I would receive a text from you. I badly wished I could tell you how I felt but I was scared you didn't feel the same way. Now I have the guts to tell you today that I am in love with you Hendriko Viljoen. I'm extremely scared I might ruin a really good friendship but this is a risk I chose to take. Amidst my most difficult times when I couldn't get a grip and the ground beneath me shook, you made see me who I really am. You made me stronger than I had ever been and I am eternally grateful for that. One thing I loved about you that made you extremely unique is that you loved and honored the God who made me. I never have and I don't think I'll ever meet a "Jesus-guy". You are kind, thoughtful and funny. I love how you are just you and I keep dreaming that one day you'll be with me. I hope reading this letter makes you feel loved and appreciated. Regardless of how you feel, please write me back. Thank you for everything.

Yours sincerely
Nthabiseng</p>
